# password-manager
Simple python script to manage passwords locally within a txt file. Based off an article on dev.to but 
with modifications and additions to add to the scripts long term usability.

## to run  locally, clone the repo and then run the command
> # python3 main.py 
on first launch, it will ask the user for a service, username, and password.
After, you have the choice to either quit or run the program again, forever. It will
continually update whatever file you choose to write to ( default will be info.txt,
but this can be changed ). 

### have fun & stay safe !
